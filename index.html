            <p>Welcome!
                Thank you for visiting this page to learn a little more about a sustainable, toxin-free cleaning
                solution that really works! I started my journey as a Norwex customer, and I loved the products so
                much that I joined as a consultant a few months later to share the Norwex mission and to improve the
                health of other households.</p>
            <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>
                I have a family that includes a curious toddler and elderly dog. I work as a full-time teacher
                during the day, and in my free time, I enjoy hosting workshops and parties to show how Norwex
                can change a toxic home into a safe haven. I started searching for safe cleaning solutions when my son
                started crawling. I was so frustrated that the other “safer” cleaners I found didn’t work well and I
                still had a poison control scare! It took over a year before I was introduced to Norwex, and once I
                tried
                it, I was hooked!
            </p>
            <p>

                Norwex microfiber cloths use just water to remove 99%* of bacteria!
                I quickly found out how much toxins in other cleaners affected us. You’ll see in one of the
                videos that my toddler enjoyed “painting” the windows by putting his hands in his mouth. I used to clean
                the
                windows with a toxic glass cleaner that he was putting in his mouth!!! Eeek!!! Now, with Norwex, I use a
                cloth slightly damp with water and it cleans streak free!
                Another example of how toxic cleaners were affecting us: I used a natural plant-based cleaner to
                clean my dog’s food and water bowl not knowing that some of the ingredients were actually toxic to
                dogs. She had a moment where she started getting clumsy and I thought it was part of her aging. Now, I
                use
                a microfiber cloth with just water and her symptoms have disappeared. I was so relieved to find
                Norwex, but also angry at myself for using something harmful in the past that I thought was a safe
                cleaner!
            </p>

                <p>
                    Norwex cleans differently than other cleaners.
                    There are three ways to clean:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Steam, which is often inconvenient</li>
                    <li>Chemically, which is dangerous and often toxic</li>
                    <li>Mechanically, which is the Norwex difference</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The microfiber cloths can pick up 99%* of bacteria using only water, and most Norwex products
                    contain BacLock technology that allows the cloths to self-purify as they dry. The best part is
                    that the mechanical clean is safe, nontoxic, and it really works! Check out the demonstration
                    with raw chicken!
                    Think of how much safer your house could be by removing bacteria, making your surfaces sparkle,
                    and removing toxic cleaners! Think of how much time and energy you could save by allowing the
                    microfiber to do the scrubbing for you! You could cut your cleaning time in half!
